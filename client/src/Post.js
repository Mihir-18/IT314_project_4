        <h2 className='text-xl mb-3'>UK hourly & day rate question</h2>
        <div className='text-sm leading-6'>Hi everyone - Like everyone I'm having the cost of living price rices affect my small freelance business (just me and a few people i contract in on jobs) and I'm reviewing my pricing. It's something I've always struggled with gauging and perhaps something I'll always second guess, but I was hoping to open up a chat on here regarding hourly and day rates and maybe it might help others too.I am a multidisciplinary digital freelancer, which makes me sound like a jack of all trades, but I've been doing this professionally full time for 17 years. I consult with brands generally to come up with an entire project and strategy, usually regarding new or improved web presence, and most of my time practically is spent building apps/websites & various projects for clients in my home office, where I build everything from scratch from my own prototypes. I've contracted for the UK government and some other agencies as a frontend dev and UX/UI designer which is another reason why I find it hard to price for freelance as the rates contracting are very good.I also do video production (degree qualified) but only the office based stuff (editing and planning) do I currently keep at the same rate as the rest of my work, so this is just regarding that.

          I'm based in Wales in the UK so companies are generally not looking to spend lots here when compared to bigger cities (London prices for example always much more), and although I have worked with big brands I've found my niche with smaller startups and locally based business with national reach who in fairness I like working with.

          Be really curious to hear a ballpark guess at what a a fair hourly rate and day rate would be - there's no right answer, i just think it would be helpful. I'm also not sure how to structure the difference between hourly and day. I always try to group work into days, but it's not always possible, and I often need to just charge someone a few hours or a day and half. So I'm not sure whether my day rate just needs to be hours x 7 for example, or i should be rewarding clients with a discounted rate for an entire day.

          Many thanks to anyone kind enough to share their input; be really cool to hear people's honest thoughts with where they're at as I'm sure most of us struggle with this in some way.
