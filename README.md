## *Repository Structure*

- The repository consists of two folders, *api* and *client*.

- *api*  contains all services that take care of the communication between the React application (frontend) and an API (backend). A single service provides multiple functions to retrieve data from or post data to an external service using the HTTP protocol.

- *client* it's our react app folder i.e. containing components, tests, css files etc. It's the mind of our app

## *Project folder Structure*
